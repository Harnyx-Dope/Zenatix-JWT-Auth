Different JWT-Auth Vulnerability Associated are:-

1. Man in the Middle Attacks(MITM)
2. Proxy Servers(like Burp Suite)
3. JWT Token Tampering and Access to the Server
4. Weak Secret Key/ Algorithm Leading to Easily Guessible. and many more 



Best Practices for Secure JWT-Based Authentication API:

1. Use Strong Secret Key: Choose a strong and unique secret key for JWT signing and ensure it is kept secure and not exposed in the code repository.

2. Use HTTPS: Always serve the API over HTTPS to encrypt data transmission between the client and server, preventing data interception.

3. Token Expiration: Set an expiration time for JWT tokens to limit their validity and reduce the risk of token misuse.

4. Secure Password Handling: Never store passwords in plain text. Instead, use strong cryptographic hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) to securely store and compare passwords.

5. Input Validation: Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection.

6. Minimal User Data in Token: Avoid including sensitive information in the token payload. Instead, store minimal user data like user ID or username.
 
7. Authentication Middleware: Use middleware to protect routes that require authentication and verify JWT tokens before granting access.

8. Disable Proxy: In a production environment, ensure that Burp Suite or any other interception proxies are disabled. These tools should only be used in controlled testing environments and not in a live production system.
